Initially, we chose to work on a Project Idea Proposal: AI-Powered Malaria Prediction and Prevention for African Communities. However, after extensive research and efforts to find sufficient data, we realized that acquiring the necessary datasets was a challenge, making it difficult to proceed with the project. As a result, we pivoted our focus to a more feasible and impactful solution.

We have now refocused our efforts on a Capstone Project Proposal: Machine Learning-Based Wheat Yield Prediction (የስንዴ ምርት ትንበያ) Using Environmental Factors. This project aims to predict wheat yield using environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and cloud cover, with the ultimate goal of helping farmers optimize their agricultural practices.

We have successfully gathered the necessary dataset, and the data has been cleaned and prepared using Google Colab and various data processing techniques, such as data wrangling, handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering. We’ve applied tools and methods such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Scikit-learn for data modeling and machine learning tasks. We are now moving forward with the development and testing of machine learning models to provide accurate yield predictions based on environmental conditions.
